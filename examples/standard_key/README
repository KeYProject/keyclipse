This directory contains subdirectories with sample .key input files
for the KeY standalone prover. 

Everyone is encouraged to add new .key files in existing or new
subdirectories. 

The subdirectories categorise the problems in certain domains like
propositional logic problems (prop_log), predicate logic problems
(pred_log), etc.

* Files in these subdirectories should NOT BE MODIFIED in a sense that the
  original intention of the denoted problem would be changed. Updates
  because of a changed input syntax are of course allowed and desired.

* .key files should have MEANINGFUL NAMES w.r.t. the contained problem.

* There is a special subdirectory `dev´ that contains examples that are
  test cases some developers want to use to test prover behaviour. It is
  recommended to mark files in `dev´ that should not be modified by
  other developers with the user name as prefix, e.g. `aroth_Test1.key´.

* The problems in the .key files are supposed to be PARSABLE and
  PROVABLE by the KeY standalone prover, if not stated otherwise in a
  comment in the file. There is one exception from this rule: .key files
  in the `dev´ subdirectory may be not parsable or not provable even if
  not commented.

* The used KeY prover VERSION must be given in a comment line at the
  beginning of the .key file.

* It is recommended to add COMMENTS describing the problem and
  comments of the proof, e.g. required user interactions. If some
  problem or its proof requires further descriptions it is recommended
  to add an EXTRA TEXT FILE (preferably a TeX source) with additional
  comments. Additional documentation files should have the same base
  name as the .key file: `test.tex´ should be documentation for a
  `test.key´ file. 

* If Java CLASSES are needed for the .key file they should be contained
  in a subdirectory below the .key file. The (relative) directory name
  is put into the java{"/path/to/classes"} section of a .key file: If
  the classes are in ~/key/system/proofExamples/cat/classes/ and the
  .key file is in ~/key/system/proofExamples/cat/ it is required to
  use 

    java { "classes" }

  to indicate the java directory.
