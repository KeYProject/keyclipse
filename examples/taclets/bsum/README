proof for bsum_induction_lower
------------------------------

int_induction over

f_i0+nv <= f_i2 ->
  bsum{int v_uSub;}(f_i0, f_i0+nv+1, f_t(v_uSub)) 
= bsum{int v_uSub;}(f_i0 + 1, f_i0+nv+1, f_t(v_uSub)) + {\subst int v_uSub;f_i0}f_t(v_uSub)

inst nv=f_i2-f_i0-1


proof for bsum_split
--------------------
(not yet finished)

needs induction over lower

induction over

f_low+nv <= f_high ->
  bsum{int v_uSub;}(f_low, f_high, f_t(v_uSub))
= bsum{int v_uSub;}(f_low, f_low+nv, f_t(v_uSub)) + bsum{int v_uSub;}(f_low+nv, f_high, f_t(v_uSub))

inst nv=fmiddle-flow
