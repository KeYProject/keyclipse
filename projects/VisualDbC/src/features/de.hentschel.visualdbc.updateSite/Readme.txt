Visual DbC
==========

Visual DbC is provided as an extension to the Eclipse platform.

Visual DbC provides a graphical notation, called DbC-Notation, that allows to 
visualize code structure together with specifications in the design by contract 
approach independent from used languages. Also proofs and references that occur
during proof execution, for instance when a method is called, are
included. The available tool support allows to create diagrams in that
notation from scratch, to generate them from existing source code and to
instantiate proofs in a verification tool. As verification tool is KeY, that
allows to verify Java code with JML specifications, supported. Other
verifications tools are integrable. Notation and tool support together are
a powerful proof management tool to support the verification process.

Important Notice
----------------

Visual DbC is currently in alpha stage.
