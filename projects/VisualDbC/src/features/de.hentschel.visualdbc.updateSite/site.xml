         Visual DbC provides a graphical notation, called DbC-Notation, that allows to visualize code structure together with specifications in the design by contract approach independent from used languages. Also proofs and references that occur during proof execution, for instance when a method is called, are included. The available tool support allows to create diagrams in that notation from scratch, to generate them from existing source code and to instantiate proofs in a verification tool. As verification tool is KeY, that allows to verify Java code with JML specifications, supported. Other verifications tools are integrable. Notation and tool support together are a powerful proof management tool to support the verification process.
