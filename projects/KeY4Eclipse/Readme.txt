(4) Setup development IDE
-------------------------
1. Download Eclipse 3.7 SR2 (Indigo) (e.g. in 32 bit version) as bundle 
   "Eclipse Modeling Tools" from
   http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools/indigosr2
2. Install find bugs
   => Help -> Eclipse Marketplace...
   => Type in Field "Find:" the value "findbugs" and press enter.
   => Install "FindBugs Eclipse Plugin" with all features.
3. Install SWTBot
   => Help -> Eclipse Marketplace...
   => Type in Field "Find:" the value "swtbot" and press enter.
   => Install "SWTBot" with all features.
4. Install SWTBot IDE
   => Help -> Install New Software...
   => Select "--All Available Sites--" in field "Work with:"
   => Select "SWTBot IDE Support (incubation)/SWTBot IDE Features (incubation)" 
      (Version 2.0.4...)
   => Install it by finishing the wizard


(5) Development (Workspace configuration)
-----------------------------------------
To develop the project it is recommended to use an empty Eclipse workspace
which can be stored in any directory. It is recommend to store it outside
of the checkout of the KeY repository. The workspace should be configured
with the settings described at:
http://i12www.ira.uka.de/~klebanov/keywiki/index.cgi?KeYDevelopmentInEclipse

To add the required Eclipse projects follow these steps:
1. Import all projects from "src" into the workspace. Use the import wizard
   "Existing Projects into Workspace" for the import.
2. Follow the steps src/plugins/org.key_project.key4eclipse/Readme.txt to
   fix the compiler failures and to make that the product is deployable.
   
   
(6) Important notice
--------------------
SWT and Swing runs both in his own UI thread. For synchronization it is
required to use Display#syncExec(Runnable) and SwingUtil#invokeAndWait(Runnable)
or Display#asyncExec(Runnable) and SwingUtil#invokeLater(Runnable). Keep
always in mind that a synchronous call is not possible from SWT or Swing thread.
In this case only an asynchronous method call is possible. If you don't
respect this knowledge Mac OS will cause deadlocks!

  "JUnit Plug-in Test". 
   
- Start SWTBot tests:
  Run class org.key_project.key4eclipse.all.test.suite.swtbot.SWTBotAllTests
  as "SWTBot Test". Use the JVM settings defined in the JavaDoc comment of 
  this class.
