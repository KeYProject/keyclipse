aboutText=Symbolic Execution Debugger (SED)\n\
\n\
This feature provides the Symbolic Execution Debugger which allows to debug a program symbolically. 
Some advantages compared to a concrete execution are that the debug session can start any method or statement
and that all possible execution paths are inspected.\n\
