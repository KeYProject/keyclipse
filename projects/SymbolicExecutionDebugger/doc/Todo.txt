TODOs for the execution tree
============================
1. If-Else problematic
   - ifElseUnfold has source location
   - ifElseSplit not
2. Handle switch case (Requires to simplify the proof tree)
3. Handle recursive methods (StackOverflowException is thrown at the moment)
4. Handle loops
5. Handle exceptional termination (Requires to read variables)
6. Show return values (Requires to read variables)
