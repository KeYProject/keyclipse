Basic idea: 
Run a renaming and compare the editor content to a given oracle, i.e. the result which should be achieved.


1) Each test in its own folder. Separated in src and oracle.
2) First files are copied and oracle string is generated.
3) Renaming is done.
4) Comparison of editor after renaming to oracle.


What is tested:

Test1: one occurrence in a simple assignable clause
Test2: additional occurrences in requires and ensures clauses
Test3: local variable with the same name (balance) and use of this qualifier
Test4: a field from another class is accessed which has the same name as the field to be renamed (balance).
Test5: the other class accesses and returns the balance field of the main class and thus need to change the name.
Test6: the other class is additionally in another package and instead of returning the balance field of the main class
      it sets the field with the local parameter called balance too.
Test7: more complex usage of balance. More than one member access.
Test8: Changes to the JML code in the other class but no changes to the java code. Other class accesses the balance field
      from the main class by using getBalance() but refers to the field in the JML code.
Test9: change within an invariant.
Test10: lots of member accesses but of the same class.
