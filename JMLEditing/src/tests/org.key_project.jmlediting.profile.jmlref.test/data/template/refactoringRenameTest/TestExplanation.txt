Basic idea: 
Run a renaming and compare the editor content to a given oracle, i.e. the result which should be achieved.


1) Each test in its own folder. Separated in src and oracle.
2) First files are copied and oracle string is generated.
3) Renaming is done.
4) Comparison of editor after renaming to oracle.


What is tested:

Test1: one occurrence in a simple assignable clause
Test2: 
...
