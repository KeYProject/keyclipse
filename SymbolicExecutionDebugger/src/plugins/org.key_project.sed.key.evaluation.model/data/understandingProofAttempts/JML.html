      <h1>JML</h1>
      <p>
         The <a href="http://www.jmlspecs.org" target="_blank">Java Modeling Language (JML)</a> is a specification language used to specify the expected behavior of Java modules.
      </p>
      <p>
         The relevant knowledge for this evaluation about JML is explained in the following sections.

      <h2><a name="comments">1 JML comments</a></h2>
      <p>
         JML specifications are placed as special comments within the Java source code.
         Such comments have to start with the <code>@</code> character.
         JML comments used in this evaluation look as follows:
         <code>
         <pre>
/*@ ...
  @ ... 
  @*/</pre></code>
      </p>

      <h2><a name="mc">2 Method Contracts</a></h2>
      <p>
         A method contract specifies the expected behavior of a method in terms of pre and postconditions.
         Assuming that the precondition is fulfilled when the method is called, the method guarantees that the postcondition is established when it returns.
         In JML the keywords <code>normal_behavior</code> and <code>exceptional_behavior</code> are used to specify that a method should terminate normally without a thrown exception or exceptionally otherwise.
         Keyword <code>requires</code> followed by an expression defines a precondition while <code>ensures</code> also followed by an expression defines a postcondition.
         An expression is basically a normal Java expression as used for instance in <code>if</code> statements.
         But additionally the implication operator <code>==></code> and quantors (e.g. <code>\forall</code>) can be used.
         The expression of the ensures clause is evaluated in the state when the method returns.
         This forms the need to access the call state (keword <code>\old</code>) and the method return value (keyword <code>\result</code>) within expressions.
         The last part of a method contract is the assignable clause.
         It lists all locations the method is allowed to change. In case the method should change nothing keyword <code>\nothing</code> is used.
      </p>
      <p>
         Consider the following example. 
         The method contract of <code>addCredits</code> says that the method should be called in a state in which <code>credits</code> is greater than zero (<code>requires</code>).
         Then the method will guarantee, that no exception is thrown (<code>normal_behavior</code>) and that the value of <code>acquiredCredits</code> is increased by <code>credits</code> (first <code>ensures</code>).
         It also guarantees that the returned value is the new value of <code>acquiredCredits</code> (second <code>ensures</code>).
         Finally, the method can only change <code>acquiredCredits</code> and not other locations like <code>firstname</code> or <code>surname</code> (<code>assignable</code>).
         <code>
         <pre>
public class Student {
   private /*@ nullable @*/ String firstname;
   
   private /*@ non_null @*/ String surname;

   private int acquiredCredits = 0;
   
   /*@ normal_behavior
     @ requires credits > 0;
     @ ensures acquiredCredits == \old(acquiredCredits) + credits;
     @ ensures \result == acquiredCredits;
     @ assignable acquiredCredits;
     @*/
   public int addCredits(int credits) {
      acquiredCredits += credits;
      return acquiredCredits;
   }
}</pre></code>
      </p>
      <p>
         For method parameters as well as for instance and class fields with a reference type its ability to be <code>null</code> needs to be specified.
         Keyword <code>nullable</code> allows the <code>null</code> value while <code>non_null</code> forbids it.
         In the example above, <code>firstname</code> might be <code>null</code> while <code>surname</code> will be never <code>null</code>.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="invariants">3 Invariants</a></h2>
      <p>
         An invariant is a property used to limit the possible state space of instances.
         All Constructors of a class have to establish the invariant while all methods have to preserve it.
         It can only be broken temporary within a method execution.
         Technically, an invariant can be seen as pre and postcondition added to all method contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
         Let us add the following invariant to class <code>Student</code>.
         It says that the value of <code>acquiredCredits</code> is never negative.
         <code>
         <pre>
/*@ invariant acquiredCredits >= 0;
  @*/
private int acquiredCredits = 0;</pre></code>
      </p>

      <h2><a name="loop">4 Loop Invariants</a></h2>
      <p>
         A loop invariant is a property which needs to hold before a loop is entered
         and which is preserved by each loop iteration (loop guard and loop body). 
         Thus it also holds after the loop. 
      </p>
      <p>
         A loop invariant in JML consists of three parts:
         <ul>
            <li>Keyword <code>loop_invariant</code> is used to specify a loop invariant.</li>
            <li>Keyword <code>decreasing</code> specifies a value which is always positive and decreased in each loop iteration. It is used by verification tools to prove termination of the loop.</li>
            <li>Keyword <code>assignable</code> is used as for method contracts to limit the locations may changed by the loop.</li>
         </ul> 
      </p>
      <p>
         The following example restricts with the first loop invariant the range of index variable <code>i</code>.
         The second loop invariant ensures that all already visisted array elements are assigned with the array index.
         Termination can be proven with help of the array length and the index variable (<code>decreasing</code> term).
         Finally, the loop can change all fields of <code>array</code> and <code>i</code>.
         <code>
         <pre>
public static void fillArray(int[] array) {
   /*@ loop_invariant i >= 0 && i <= array.length;
     @ loop_invariant (\forall int j; j >= 0 && j < i; array[j] == j);
     @ decreasing array.length - i;
     @ assignable array[*], i;
     @*/      
   for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      array[i] = i;
   }
}</pre></code>
      </p>
