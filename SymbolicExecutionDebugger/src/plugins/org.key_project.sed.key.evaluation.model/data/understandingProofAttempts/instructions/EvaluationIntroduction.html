      <h2><a name="target">1 Target of Questions</a></h2>
      <p>
         The evaluation wizard asks questions related to the content currently shown in Eclipse.
         In the screenshot below questions are asked about the currently opened web browser.
         <b>During this evaluation, questions will be asked about a proof attempt opened in KeY (external window) or the Symbolic Execution Debugger (perspective in Eclipse).</b>
      </p>
      <p>
         The evaluation wizard does not block Eclipse. This means that Eclipse is fully functional and can be used without closing the evaluation wizard.

         <ol>
            <li>If available, the first items open a previously shown introduction page (like this one) again in a separate shell.</li>
            <li>If available, the reset item <img src="EvaluationIntroduction/icons/resetWorkbench.gif" width="16" height="16" /> restores the workbench with the target of the current questions. During this evaluation, you should click on it if you have for instance accidentally closed or modified the proof or the Java source code with JML specifications.</li>
            <li>The pin window item <img src="EvaluationIntroduction/icons/pin_view.gif" width="16" height="16" /> defines if the evaluation wizard is shown always on top of Eclipse or not.</li>
