      <h2><a name="set">1 Symbolic Execution</a></h2>
      <p>
         Symbolic execution allows to explore all feasible execution paths of a program at once.
         This is achieved by using symbolic values in lieu of concrete values.
         Whenever the knowledge about a symbolic value is not enough to follow a single execution path,
         symbolic execution splits to cover all feasible execution paths.
         This results in a so called <i>symbolic execution tree</i>
      </p> 
      <p>
         Consider for instance the following Java program.
         Method <code>equals</code> checks if the given <code>Number</code> instance has the same <code>content</code> as the current one.
         <code>
         <pre>
public class Number {
   private int content;

   public boolean equals(Number n) {
      if (content == n.content) {
         return true;
      }
      else {
         return false;
      }
   }
}         
         </pre>
         </code>
      </p>
      <p>
         The resulting symbolic execution tree of method <code>equals</code> is shown in the following.
         The root is a <i>start</i> node representing the program fragment to execute.
         As we are interested in method <code>equals</code>, it is called next represented by a <i>method call</i> node.
         The if statement is supposed to split execution and thus represented as <i>branch statement</i>.
         Here execution splits first in case that <code>n</code> is <code>null</code> or not and in latter case again in case that the <code>content</code> is identical or not.
         The conditions under which a branch is taken are shown as <i>branch condition</i> nodes.
         In case that <code>n</code> is <code>null</code>, the method returns with an uncaught <i>NullPointerException</i> indicated by the <i>exceptional method return</i> node.
         Finally, this path terminates exceptionally shown by the <i>exceptional termination</i> node.
         In case that <code>n</code> is not <code>null</code>, a return statement is executed. As this statement is not supposed to split execution, a <i>statement</i> node is used.
         The <i>method return</i> nodes indicate that a called method is now returned and for non void methods the possible return values are shown as part of the node label.
         Finally, a <i>termination</i> node indicate that an execution path terminates normally without an uncaught exception.
