/**
 * <p>
 * The interface for term labels. Term labels are annotations that can be attached
 * to {@link Term}s and carry additional information. 
 * <b>They must not be soundness relevant</b>. But they may be used in strategies
 * to compute the order in which rules are applied.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A term label can have parameters accessible via {@link #getChild(int)} and
 * {@link #getChildCount()}. Such parameters can be any {@link Object}.
 * But keep in mind that it is required to parse {@link String}s into {@link Term}s,
 * e.g. if it is used in a Taclet definition or if a cut rule is applied.
 * For convenience parameters are always printed as {@link String}s
 * and have to be parsed individually into the required {@link Object} instances
 * via {@link LabelFactory#createLabel(String, java.util.List)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@link Term}s with or without term labels are still unmodifiable.
 * It is recommended to implement {@link ITermLabel}s also unmodifiable.
 * This means also that it is recommended that parameters of {@link ITermLabel}s are also unmodifiable.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * During proof it is the responsibility of {@link ITermLabelWorker} instances to
 * maintain or remove existing term labels or to add new one.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To implement a new term label the following steps are required:
 * <ol>
 *    <li>Create a subclass of {@link ITermLabel}.</li>
 *    <li>Modify {@link LabelFactory#createLabel(String, java.util.List)} to ensure that instances of the new {@link ITermLabel} sub class are created when a {@link String} is parsed into a {@link Term}.</li>
 *    <li>If required implement an {@link ITermLabelWorker} which maintains the new term labels during proof. Ensure that this {@link ITermLabelWorker} instance is registered in {@link Profile#getLabelInstantiators()}. Typically this is achieved by adding the new {@link ITermLabelWorker} instance in {@link AbstractProfile#computeLabelInstantiators()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
