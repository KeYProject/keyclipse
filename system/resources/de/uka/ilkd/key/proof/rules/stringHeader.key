//Changes in KeYHeap: 
//-All occurrences of "jchar" have been replaced by "int", which generally replaces the sort "jchar" in KeYHeap.
//-"\nonRigid[Location]" functions have become constants of type "Field"
//-Function names have been prefixed with "str" to avoid name clashes

//pool and content seem to not be used in any rules??
